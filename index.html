          <p>This simple, console-based program is something I wrote for a job application using Java.</p>

<p>The premise is simple but silly. Basically, this program is meant for the intergalactic traveler who's traversing the universe and selling various ores. However, being an ignorant earthling, you struggle converting between intergalactic units and your own to figure out how much stuff is worth. This program helps you do those conversions to help you do business better.</p>

<p>The intergalactic units are based on Roman numerals, which made conversions fun.</p>

<p>In terms of my design choices, I am aware that I chose not to utilize any collections classes. This was a calculated decision on my part, based on two facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>The longest Roman numeral possible is 13 characters long.</li>
<li>The length of the unit names is 4 characters, making the longest possible combination still under 100 characters.</li>
</ol><p>Since the units were based on Roman numerals, the amount this program could scale isn't very much--although I will admit that use of collections might have increased my efficiency slightly.</p>
